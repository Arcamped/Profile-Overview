An explanatory guide of the 'what's what' of my Github.

## [Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/Arcamped/Prompt-Engineering)   (Meed and RPG) ##
 
Meed is a start-up a cofounded that allows people to challenge each other (e.g. Do 10 push-ups in the snow, shirtless). The code is still in use (https://meed.app/), so I cannot post it to Git, but I can tell you I built the Twitch and Discord integrations using JavaScript (as well as some other backend code). To test out the Discord version, head over to our Discord and use slash commands to get started! I also designed and built our challenge suggestion engine which uses the GPT series from OpenAI. To see how I approached the prompt engineering, please see here: https://github.com/Arcamped/Prompt-Engineering/blob/main/Meed

Another project I'm working on is using transformers (once again, primarily the GPT series from OpenAI) to explore the limits of AI-driven storytelling. I started this project in early 2022 and postponed it after a few months. Of the models available at the time, only davinci had the power to reliably generate reasonably interesting stories and maintain a consistent plot -- this also meant it wasn't a financially affordable project. With the reduction in pricing and increased power of recent generations, I've resumed work. Much of the work is private, but to see an example of one approach I'm using, please see: https://github.com/Arcamped/Prompt-Engineering and navigate to "GPT RPG".

## Evolutionary Search Space ##

During my grad school program I had an interesting idea: could one apply tools from Computational Complexity Theory to Evolution? That question has guided my independent research since then. The title "Evolutionary Search Space" borrows from the "Search Space" used in mathematics and refers to the space nature has to search through to find the solution to an evolutionary "problem".

My own exploration has led to a project that looks at knowledge representation in nature, specifically when it comes to codons and their resultant amino acids. In technical terms, we treat amino acids as heterogeneous hypergraphs and attempt to build them in a series of discrete time steps using their base sequence as rules for graph generation. In non-technical terms, if one is assembling a puzzle and the first instruction is "A", does it matter whether the second instruction is a "G" or a "C"? If it does matter, we're dealing with one interpretation framework; and if it doesn't, another.

The program I wrote to tackle this program is written in Python; it features an algorithm I designed to avoid brute force searching through all possible combinations, and the usual work in Pandas (and so data cleaning) one expects from such a project. The work is ongoing, but you can find the code here (feel free to test out your own Interpretation Frameworks :) :https://github.com/Arcamped/Amino-Acid-Project-Public

## Grad School Analysis and Econometrics ##
I received a Masters in Agricultural and Applied Economics (focus in Resource Energy Demand Analysis) from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2018.
The work I did there is no longer reflective of my programming skills, but a historical view of what I've done in R might interest some people. The project in question looked at the efficacy of air conditioner cycling programs. Without further ado: https://github.com/Arcamped/Analysis-Samples     

## Snow Wars: Animating in VR ##

Before attending grad school I worked on a fairly serious project (800 - 1000 hours) with the intent of pursuing a career in storytelling in VR. Upon the conclusion of said project (Snow Wars), I realized my passion lay in storytelling and *not* animating. Still, I had a great time learning and applying concepts in Maya. If you want to see a story high on concept and low on execution (animation is quite hard), here you are: https://www.youtube.com/@michaelcampbell546

## Books ##

If the Snow Wars project is only loosely appropriate for Git, then this entry is even more beyond the pale -- I've written three books and I'm working on more. The first three books were exercises in storytelling while I developed my craft, overcome creative insecurities, and worked on worldbuilding for an Epic Fantasy series I've wanted to tell since grad school. Hope you enjoy!

[**Let Sleeping Dragons Lie**](https://www.amazon.com/Let-Sleeping-Dragons-Michael-Campbell-ebook/dp/B09HGJFWPQ/ref[…]=michael+campbell+let+sleeping+dragons+lie%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-1) (Mystery, Comedy) - "A letter arrived in the mail today. An occurrence peculiar enough in its own right, of course; I mean, who sends a letter? But no, that wasn’t the real mystery, though it certainly contributed: a painting, my painting, was on sale. A work I had put on canvas twenty years ago in second grade. I hadn’t seen, let alone touched, a paintbrush in two decades. And yet my painting was on auction — in Japan." 

[**Love At First Swipe**](https://www.amazon.com/Love-First-Swipe-Michael-Campbell-ebook/dp/B087JMRKV5/ref=sr_[…]refix=michael+campbell+love+at+first+swipe%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1) (Satirical Romantic Comedy) - "Chad and Veronica. Veronica and Chad. Two souls, like all main characters in the standard romance stories that even now plague our society, fated to meet. Will our heroes overcome the evils that life throws their way? Will their quest for requited love survive the horrors of the modern dating scene? Maybe, maybe not, for sinister forces -- both from without and within -- assail this likely couple on all sides."

[**Creation**](https://www.amazon.com/Creation-Michael-Campbell-ebook/dp/B07Q76YCCG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GPMH193AWHUH&keywords=Michael+Campbell+creation&qid=1678159505&sprefix=michael+campbell+creation%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1) (Science Fiction) - "2040. Ten years after the greatest economic depression in human history officially ended. On Mars, Adam, Verdat’s newest employee at the five-year-old Martian colony, is narrowly saved from his rover’s destruction in the Martian wilderness by his brain implant. When he returns to the colony his investigation into the rover crash runs into an immediate complication: all communication with Earth has been mysteriously severed. With an implant that has as many opinions as he does, Adam must find a way to survive in the most inhospitable land humanity has ever settled. On Earth, Mira, a fiery Verdat scientist, has almost perfected taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere using engineered microorganisms. Jealous governments and corporate competitors demand she prove she can perform the process without harming the environment while they try to replicate her breakthroughs. With potential threats on all sides, Mira must find a way to ensure her project’s success — humanity’s existence on the world depends on it."
