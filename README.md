# Profile-Overview
An explanatory guide of the 'what's what' of my Github.


Some code samples from various analysis projects I've worked on can be found in: https://github.com/Arcamped/Analysis-Samples     

Mostly that is work in R and demonstrates competency with data cleaning and manipulation as well as various 
econometric models.


Some of the work I'm doing with writing quantum programs can be found here: https://github.com/Arcamped/Quantum-Trickery- .
This repository is a lot less final than the code samples from the analysis projects and is likely to change regularly.
